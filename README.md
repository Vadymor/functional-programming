## Project description

The source of disaster events is EONET API. 
*disaster_api_stream.py* retrieves data asynchronously and converts it into events stream.

The source of calendar events is Google Calendar API. 
*GoogleCalendarAPI_EventStream.py* retrieves data asynchronously and converts it into events stream.
Events for calendar were generated by *GoogleCalendarAPI_EventGenerator.py*

Both streams write events into DB (*disaster.db*, SQLite) by *disaster_saver.py*: 
- the disaster events are written into disaster_event table;
- the calendar events are written int calendar_event table.

To start disaster stream, run command:

    python disaster_api_stream.py

To start calendar stream, run command:

    python GoogleCalendarAPI_EventStream.py

The data from *disaster.db* is processed by *sender.py*.
Below you can find notifications rules:
- if the distance between calendar and disaster events is less than 300 km;
- and if the time delta between them is less than 45 days.

Only eligible events are sent to Telegram chat to notify you, that your calendar events are threatened. 

Here is a notification example:

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">Your planned event Bus at 2021-06-14T15:20:19 02:00 is threatened by Wildfire MB-NO102, Manitoba, Canada.</span>
